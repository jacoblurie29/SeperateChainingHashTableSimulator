# SeperateChainingHashTableSimulator

This project simulates a hash table with seperate chaining.

The code is tested using a single string input in the main class of HashTableClass.java

To populate the hash table, the program divides the input string into individual words and then sorts them as such, rehashing when necessary.

The initial size of the hash table array is set to 10 so that the rehash method can be demonstrated after the load factor threshold is passed.

"src" folder is in "HashTableAssignment" folder
